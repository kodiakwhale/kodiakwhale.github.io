					Here I'm going to test my Unity optimization showerthoughts.
					<P></P>
					Empty scene frametime with nothing but the default MainCamera and Directional Light: 0.5ms
					
					Average cost of commonly used functions (i5-6500):
					GameObject.AddComponent: 0.01 to 0.05ms
					Transform.SetParent: 0.005ms to 0.02ms for transforms with less than 10 children
					
					While it may not seem like it, 0.01ms is very expensive and adds up fast. Avoid using multiple times per frame.
					<p></p>
					Do complex scripts have a higher overhead than simple scripts?
					
					No! I created 10000 GameObjects at runtime, once adding a component with 10 lines of code then adding one with 500.
					With none of the functions being called on either component, there was no performance difference at all.
					
					What about the number of components?
					
					Again, surprisingly, no! It seems that static GameObjects have almost no performance overhead.
					
					I got curious and spawned in 1,000,000 empty GameObjects. It still had the same 0.5ms frametime as all the other tests.
					Instantiating another empty GameObject after a few seconds took a little less than 1ms.
